# UI Element Project

This project is going to challenge you to combine your programming skills in
JavaScript with your skills building out user interfaces with HTML and CSS.

## Prerequisites

- HTML and CSS
- CSS Layout
- Programming with JavaScript
- Working with the DOM

## Instructions

1. Create a new repository on GitHub (not GitHub Enterprise).
1. Clone down the repository and complete your work in there.
1. Fulfill the listed requirements below.

Please turn in your submission by the deadline on your cohort calendar.

## UI Pattern

You will need to pick a UI pattern from the list below and an API. You'll then
build out the UI pattern you chose to work with the API you chose.

### List of UI Patterns

* **Modal**: When a user clicks on a link, a box should appear in the center of the
    screen with the details for the item that the user clicks on. The box should
    have some way for the user to close the box and see the full list of items.
* **Hamburger Menu**: There should be a hamburger icon in the top right corner. When
    a user clicks on it, a menu should appear from off of the right side of the
    screen with a list of menu items. When the user clicks on the menu item, the
    contents in the center of the page should change to show the details for
    that item. The user should be able to see which item is currently selected.
    The user should be able to close the menu by clicking the hamburger menu
    again.
* **Accordion**: The user should see a list of items. When they click on one, the
    space below the item expands to reveal the content related to that item.
    When the user clicks on the item again, the revealed content becomes hidden.
* **Tabs**: The user sees a row of tabs above a content area. When the user clicks
    on one of the tabs, the content in the content area changes based on which
    tab the user clicked.
* **Slider**: The user should see the content on the screen with 'Next' and
    'Previous' buttons. When they click on the 'Next' button, the slider should
    shift to show the next item in the list. When the user clicks on the
    'Previous' button, the slider should shift to show the previous items in the
    list. If there is no next or previous items, the slider could loop to the
    other end of the list or prevent the user from clicking those buttons.

### List of APIs

This is a non-exhaustive list:

1. Marvel: developer.marvel.com
1. Star Wars: swapi.co
1. Weather: openweathermap.org/api
1. News: newsapi.org
1. Giphy: developers.giphy.com
1. Pokemon: http://pokeapi.co
1. Google Books: developers.google.com/books
1. City of Chicago: data.cityofchicago.org
1. Beer: brewerydb.com/developers
1. Chuck Norris: http://www.icndb.com
1. Rick and Morty: rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest
1. Dad Jokes: icanhazdadjoke.com/api
1. NASA: api.nasa.gov

There is also [this collection of public APIs](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis).

## Requirements

Each student should pick one UI Pattern and one API and combine the two. The
data to populate the UI Pattern should come from the API. When the user loads
the page, they should see the data from the API load into the UI pattern on the
screen.

### Technical Requirements

Your project should meet the following requirements:

- Runs without errors
- Shows the UI pattern you selected populated with data from the API you selected
- Functions according to the descriptions above. The user should be able to
    interact with your UI.
- Includes a README written in well formatted Markdown (_hint: look up a README
    template_)
- Shows a good commit history with frequent commits. We're looking for lots of
    small commits.
